# Jon Skeet's Miscellaneous Utility Library #
A library of little bits and bobs to make life easier.

Every so often, someone on the newsgroup asks about something which doesn't exist in the framework, but which I think should. Sometimes, I'll write some code for them to plug the gap. Just occasionally, I'll tidy up the code, add XML documentation comments etc, and include it in my miscellaneous utility library. This library will, of course, grow over time.

Due to the nature of the library, some of the code may not have been particularly rigorously tested. You are strongly advised to give it a thorough testing before including it in any important code. Note: as of November 2006, I'm gradually adding unit tests, so the quality should improve significantly.
